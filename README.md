These are just some files I have to improve my quality of life when working in Windows.

NOTE: Some of the batch files reference .phar files. Find and place the phar files in the same directory.

# Stuff to Install

- **Clink** - http://mridgers.github.io/clink/  
  *Better CMD functionality* 

- **ConEmu** - http://conemu.github.io/en/  
  *Replaces the Windows CMD with something decent.*


# ConEmu

- For emoji support, go to `Settings / Environment` and add the following line:

        chcp utf8

- To replace Windows CMD prompt, go to `Settings / Integration / Default term` and check:
    - ✓ Force ConEmu as default terminal for console applications
    - ✓ Register on OS startup
